This repository contains several branches, with pull requests, which are not yet merged into the main repository.  If you want to use all these on top of the original devil mode, you can checkout and use the ~dev~ branch.  If you are using emacs >= 30 you could use ~use-package~ with the ~:vc~ keyword:

                           ("%k m b" "%k m f" "%k m a" "%k m e")
                           ("%k m m f" "%k m m b" "%k m m a" "%k m m e"

Devil mode trades your comma key in exchange for a modifier-free
editing experience in Emacs.  Yes, the comma key!  The key you would
normally wield for punctuation in nearly every corner of text.  Yes,
this is twisted!  It would not be called the Devil otherwise, would
it?  If it were any more rational, we might call it something divine,
like, uh, the God mode?  But alas, there is nothing divine to be found
here.  Welcome, instead, to the realm of the Devil!  You will be
granted the occasional use of the comma key for punctuation, but only
if you can charm the Devil.  But beware, for in this sinister domain,
you must relinquish your comma key and embrace an editing experience
that whispers wicked secrets into your fingertips!

** Introduction
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: introduction
:END:

Devil is available in MELPA as well as NonGNU ELPA.  If you are using
Emacs 28.1 or a more recent version of Emacs, you can get the latest
stable version of Devil by typing =M-x package-install RET devil RET=.
Otherwise, you need to add MELPA or NonGNU ELPA to your list of
package archives and then install MELPA.  More details on the
installation procedure is provided in the [[https://susam.github.io/devil/][manual]].

By default, Devil mode rebinds the comma key to activate Devil.  Once
activated, Devil reads a so-called Devil key sequence from you.  As
you type your Devil key sequence, Devil translates the key sequence to
a regular Emacs key sequence.  If any command is bound to the
translated Emacs key sequence, Devil runs that command and then
deactivates itself.

By default, each comma in the Devil key sequence is translated to
"C-".  For example, if you type ", x , f", Devil translates it to "C-x
C-f".  Similarly ", m" is translated to "M-".  If you type ", m x",
Devil translates it to "M-x".  Further ", m m" is translated to
"C-M-".  If you type ", m m f" Devil translates it to "C-M-f".  There
are several other translations available in the default translation
rules that let you enjoy working with Emacs while avoiding modifier
keys.  Further, the Devil activation key, translation rules, etc. are
customisable.  Thus if you do not like the default choices made in
this package, you can customise it easily to suit your preferences.
